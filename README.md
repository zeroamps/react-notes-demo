# React Notes Demo

This is a React Notes Demo application, which you can see on [DEMO](https://zeroamps.github.io/react-notes-demo/).

This demo was created to test Vite, which is a frontend tooling. Notes are stored in the localStorage and you can also use the Markdown language when you write notes. For converting Markdown to HTML I use the react-markdown library.
